### Generating the keys
1. The keys are generated by selecting 2 prime numbers. In this implementation we just need a number n as input, which will be used to generate the prime numbers 
<em><strong>x</strong></em> and <em><strong>y</strong></em>. 
Those numbers need to be large so that they will be difficult for someone to figure out.
  
    For that we have the constructor:
    ```
    private final int number;

    public RSA(int number) {
        this.number = number;
        generateKey();
    }
    ```
    And the following lines from the method generateKey():
    ```
    BigInteger x = BigInteger.probablePrime(number/2, new SecureRandom());
    BigInteger y = BigInteger.probablePrime(number/2, new SecureRandom());
    ```
2. The modulus <em><strong>n</strong></em> is the product of <em><strong>x</strong></em> and <em><strong>y</strong></em>.
