# The title of the work

### Course: Cryptography & Security
### Author: Rafaela Cerlat

----

## Theory
If needed and written by the author.


## Objectives:
1. Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.

2. Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution,
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet,
    - Vigenere cipher,
    - Playfair cipher.

3. Structure the project in methods/classes/packages as needed.


## Implementation description

* Firt of all I have the Cipher interface in which the alphabet size is set to 26(because English is used), and abstract 
* methods.



```
public static void main() 
{

}
```
